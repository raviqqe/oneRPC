The RPC library for the serverless and TypeScript era.

## Features

- 🔮 Seamless client-server communication
  You can call remote procedures just as seamless as calling local functions.
- 🛡️ Type safe
  Server-client communication is made safe with request and response types in TypeScript which are used by both client and server.
- 🔥 Serverless first
  Routing is delegated to other frameworks or infrastructures.
- 🤝 HTTP friendly
  You can leverage full potential of HTTP functionalities, such as cache control headers.
- 🐁 Minimal dependencies
  It depends only on [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). Thus, it works on many platforms including Node.js, Deno, and edges.
- 🌊 Streaming
  Stream responses are transferred as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) and clients can consume them chunk by chunk.
