# oneRPC

The RPC library for the serverless and TypeScript era.

## Features

- Type safe
  - Server-client communication is made safe with request and response types in TypeScript that are used by both client and server.
- Zero routing
  - Routing is delegated to other frameworks or infrastructures.
- Streaming
  - Stream responses are transferred as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) and clients can consume them chunk by chunk.
